WPI NOTES

ToDo:
X -Reduce margins on text_display
X -Separate running components to make restarting nodes easier
X -Make output of the controller node more readable/useful
X -Have the robot automatically move to neutral position after picking up a cube
X -Combine PLAYER1 and PLAYER2 to a single position, automate the entire cube showing process to one button
X -Make position click counter unaffected by sending messages
X -create functions for the different sequences to make them easier to call
 - Fix realsense mount and lighting conditions
 - Order longer usb 3 extendo

COMPONENT SEPARATION
1. roscore (so that launch files share the same environment)
2. wpi_controller / arm.launch (ur5e_workstation.launch, rviz, GripperTCP node, camera node)
3. text_display / text_display.launch (shouldn't need to be reset)
4. wpi_controller / gui.launch (controller node, and GUI)
